n this project you will implement a program that will simulate multiprocessor
scheduling. The program will simulate two approaches for multiprocessor
scheduling: single-queue approach, and multi-queue approach (Figures 1 and
2). In single-queue approach, we have a single common ready queue
(runqueue) that is used by all processors. In multi-queue approach, each
processor has its own ready queue. Your program will simulate the following
scheduling algorithms: FCFS (first-come first-served), SJF (shortest job first -
nonpreemptive), and RR(Q) (round robin with time quantum Q)
